# Unit2.Froyo
Overview
As you pick out your froyo flavor at your favorite local frozen yogurt shop, you overhear the management team discussing how they would like a way for customers to order online. You make small talk and offer your services to help them build a web app. 

Requirements
Build your website according to this user story:

A visitor receives a prompt upon opening the website to enter a list of comma-separated froyo flavors. They type vanilla,vanilla,vanilla,strawberry,coffee,coffee. When they view the browser console, they observe a table listing how many of each flavor they have ordered. In this case, they will be able to observe that they have ordered three vanilla, two coffee, and one strawberry froyo.

Getting Started
There is no starter code for this workshop; the solutions to previous workshops will be great to review!

Create a new repository named Unit2.Froyo on GitHub and clone it down.
Add your cohort team to the repository you just made.
Open the project with VS Code and create an HTML file and a JavaScript file.
Figure out a plan for what code you'll need to write based on the user story. Use the rubric to guide you.
